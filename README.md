# This is
boilerplate for drawing a fragment shader ala editor.thebookofshaders.com in c using glfw

# Will probably never be
a mode for, or port of processing 

# Aspirations
[windows specific version with zero dependencies](https://github.com/Prince-Polka/Hello-Fragment-Shader/blob/master/HFS.zip) (no glfw just windows.h) ,
implementing some core functionallity inspired by the processing.org project (not yet implemented)
