#This is
boilerplate for drawing a fragment shader ala editor.thebookofshaders.com in c using glfw

#Aspirations
windows specific version with zero dependencies (no glfw just windows.h) ,
implementing some core functionallity inspired by the processing.org project

#Will probably never be
a mode for, or port of processing
